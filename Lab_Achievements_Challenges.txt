Juice Bottle Lab

Achieved Requirements:
-	The program has three Plants (data parallelization)
-	The Plants have 11 workers that only change one state of the orange depending
        on their job assignment (task parallelization).
-	The final project was committed and pushed up to GitHub via the command line.
-	Documentation with instructions on how to clone and run the program.
-	A UML diagram.
-	Identified critical sections and shared data structures with comments describing what actions were taken.
-   Extra Credit
    -	Using ANT for building and running the program through the command line.


Challenges:
	I found this lab challenging because I had weak knowledge on how to implement
	multiple threads correctly. I originally tried to have my Plants
	as threads with them managing multiple workers, which were also threads.
	I created a new class for the workers but found problems with coordinating
	the multiple levels of threads within each other. Another challenge I faced
	was working with synchronizing access to the multiple queues that I
	created for each process state of the orange.
