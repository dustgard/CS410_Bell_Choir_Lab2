Challenges:
	I found this lab challenging because I had weak knowledge on how to implement
	multiple threads correctly. I originally tried to have my Plants
	as threads with them managing multiple workers, which were also threads.
	I created a new class for the workers but found problems with coordinating
	the multiple levels of threads within each other. Another challenge I faced
	was working with synchronizing access to the multiple queues that I
	created for each process state of the orange.
